# LiteGrabber

LiteGrabber is a simple website content scrapper that utilizing the default 
PHP DOMXPath class.

## Installation
You can install LiteGrabber using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

`composer require aprillins/litegrabber:dev-master`

Then, update your package.

`composer update`

Don't forget to execute `composer dumpautoload` after the installation.

## Usage

Using LiteGrabber is tremendously easy. Scrapping can be done with three simple
step. First, create the LiteGrabber instance.

```php
$liteGrabber = new LiteGrabber($url);
```

Second, create the query for which element you want to scrap. For example, if 
you want to get a link from `a` tag inside `div` tag the query will be like 
this.

```php
$query = $liteGrabber->div([], true)->a()->atSrc()->getQuery();
```

Third, let's get the result!

```php
$liteGrabber->getResult();
```

The result will be returned in a form of array. The result will be an empty 
array if your query compositions don't match with the actual element on a web 
page you want to scrap.

## Query Explanation
On the second step above, you see that `div([], true)` have to parameters. The 
first one is specification of tag attribute. If you want to scrap specifically
from `div` which has certain class attribute with certain value. You have to
set the array.

```php
div(['class' => 'post-wrapper home'], true)
```

Example above will set the query to `<div class="post-wrapper home">`. You MUST
NOT forget to put second argument to `true` for the first query.

If you have done arranging the query, end it with `getQuery()` to make sure
that you reach the end of query and ready to process to the next step.

The LiteGrabber is tested with PHPUnit.
